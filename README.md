# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Prediction Model (3-Strategy Screener)

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts which stocks are likely to go up based on three trading strategies: short-term, breakout, and swing trades. The system uses engineered technical indicators, a TensorFlow classification model, and live data from Yahoo Finance to generate daily predictions for over 6000 tickers.

## ðŸ“¥ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaamSani/stock-prediction-project.git
   cd stock-prediction-project
   ```

2. **Add Raw Ticker Data**
   Place all stock CSVs (one per ticker) into:
   ```
   data/stock_data/
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure Python â‰¥ 3.8 is installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow yfinance
   ```

4. **Run the Notebooks in Order**
   - `1_data_preparation.ipynb`: Combines raw CSVs and prepares base dataset
   - `2_data_engineering.ipynb`: Adds technical features and target labels
   - `3_model_training.ipynb`: Trains TensorFlow model and predicts top 20 tickers

## ðŸ“Š Trading Strategies

When prompted in Notebook 3, youâ€™ll choose a strategy:

| Option | Strategy Name       | Description                                      |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| A      | Short-Term Pick     | Stock is expected to go up tomorrow             |
| B      | Breakout Opportunity| Stock is expected to jump 10%+ in the next 3 days|
| C      | Swing Trade         | Stock is expected to close higher in 5 days     |

## âœ… Example Output

```
Top 20 stocks the model predicts will go UP based on: Target_B

 1.  NVDA   â€” Confidence: 93.21% â€” Live Price: $950.12
 2.  AMD    â€” Confidence: 91.74% â€” Live Price: $134.87
 ...
20.  META   â€” Confidence: 82.45% â€” Live Price: $477.30
```

Predictions are saved as CSV files inside the `/data/` folder.

## ðŸ§  Model Details

- **Framework**: TensorFlow (Keras Sequential)
- **Model Type**: Binary Classification
- **Target**: 1 = stock predicted to go up, 0 = otherwise
- **Architecture**:
  - Dense(64, ReLU)
  - Dense(32, ReLU)
  - Dense(1, Sigmoid)

Each trading strategy (A, B, C) uses its own target column (`Target_A`, `Target_B`, `Target_C`) for training and evaluation.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Over **6000 tickers** used from the stock market
- Live prices pulled in real time via the `yfinance` API
- Results are ranked by model confidence and saved to CSV
- Supports daily updates and re-training with new data
